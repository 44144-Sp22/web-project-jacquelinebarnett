        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I am Jacqueline Barnett and I am a sophomore at Northwest Missouri State University. I created this website to showcase one of my favorite hobbies, photography. I have always loved taking pictures of anything and everything.
          Whenever
          something catches my eye, I make sure to capture it. I also love looking back at photos and reminiscing on the memories that were made.
